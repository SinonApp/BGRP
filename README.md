# Introduction
BGRP is a routing protocol specifically designed to optimize routing decisions made by gateway devices in computer networks. It aims to provide efficient and reliable routing, ensuring that network traffic is forwarded along the most optimal paths while considering factors such as network congestion, link availability, and quality of service.

BGRP utilizes advanced algorithms and metrics to calculate the best routes within a network, taking into account various parameters such as bandwidth, latency, and load balancing. It is suitable for both small and large-scale networks, offering scalability and adaptability to changing network conditions.

# Features
BGRP offers a range of features that make it an excellent choice for gateway routing. Some of its key features include:

- __Dynamic Routing:__ BGRP dynamically adapts to changes in the network topology and automatically adjusts the routing tables accordingly. This enables efficient handling of network expansions, failures, and reconfigurations.

- __Advanced Metrics:__ BGRP employs sophisticated metrics to calculate the best routes. It considers factors like bandwidth, delay, reliability, and cost, allowing for intelligent path selection based on network conditions and policies.

- __Load Balancing:__ BGRP supports load balancing by distributing network traffic across multiple paths, thus preventing congestion and optimizing resource utilization. This feature enhances network performance and minimizes bottlenecks.

- __Fault Tolerance:__ BGRP provides fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure high network availability. It quickly detects failures and redirects traffic through alternate routes, minimizing downtime and improving network resilience.

- __Security:__ BGRP includes built-in security features to protect against unauthorized access, spoofing, and other common network attacks. It offers authentication, encryption, and integrity checking mechanisms to safeguard routing information.

# Installation
To install BGRP, please follow these steps:

Download the latest version of BGRP from the official website or the designated repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:SinonApp/BGRP.git && cd ./BGRP
```

Run the installation script included with the package. Make sure to follow the provided instructions and prompts.

```
chmod +x ./install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```

Once the installation is complete, configure BGRP settings according to your network requirements. This may involve modifying configuration files or using a command-line interface provided by the software. __See next content section...__

Start the BGRP service or daemon on your gateway device.
```
systemctl enable --now bgrp.service
```
Congratulations! You have successfully installed BGRP on your gateway device.

# Configuring
```
listen_interface = 'ens3'
listen_direction = 'out' # in, out, inout

route_table = 0 # Change on your route table

gateways = {
        '10.10.0.2': 1102,
        '10.10.0.3': 1103,
        '10.10.0.4': 1104,
}

bypass_list = [
        '1.1.1.1',
        '8.8.8.8',
        ...
]
```
